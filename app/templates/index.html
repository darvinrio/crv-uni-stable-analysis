                    Uniswap and Curve.fi are household names for degens on the Ethereum Mainnet. They are behemoths in the world of DEXes. Both swallowing most of the swapping activity on the Ethereum Mainnet. While Uniswap boasts itself of some of the largest volumes of Liquidity Locked, Curve.fi is a behemoth in stable pair, i.e assets that trade around 1:1 ratio. Uniswap v2's product curve AMM did manage to capture most of the swaps on the mainnet, yet the user-experience with respect to price slippage was bad. This was a huge thorn in Uniswap v2's arsenal, one which kept Curve.fi in the DEX game. Curve used a different AMM (more on that later), to reduce price slippage in stable pairs while also charging lesser liquidity fees than Uniswap v2. 
                    <br>
                    Uniswap v3, was launched with a different approach to Curve.fi, in order to tackle the slippage problem. But did Uniswap v3 succeed in it and dethrone Curve.fi as the stable-swap king ?

                        The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.
    
                        There are currently three versions of the Uniswap protocol. V1 and V2 are open source and licensed under GPL. V3 is open source with slight modifications, which are viewable here. Each version of Uniswap, once deployed, will function in perpetuity, with 100% uptime, provided the continued existence of the Ethereum blockchain.

                            Curve is an exchange. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralised protocols exchange stablecoins (DAI to USDC for example) through it with low fees and low slippage. Unlike exchanges out there that match a buyer and a seller, the behaviour of Curve is different, it uses liquidity pools like Uniswap. To achieve this, Curve needs liquidity (tokens) which is rewarded by those who provide it.

                        Uniswap is a DEX where a liquidity provider provides Liquidity in the form of two token in a ratio that is reasonably comparable to the market valuation, so a user could swap the one token for another. Curve.fi does the same work, however it restricts itself to stable-pairs, i.e pairs that trade around 1. 
                        <br>
                        The main difference between these two protocols lie on the pairs they trade, and the methodology behind swapping in their respective pools. So one must understand how the swap-mechanism works in both pools before understanding the slippage.

            <div class="title">Understanding the AMMs</div>
            Centralized exchanges use Order-Books to provide liquidity. These are extremely robust, and allow the CEX to keep the gaps filled optimally.This however isn't possible with DeFi. The blockchains on top of which these Market Makers are built have slow response times and have underlying gas fees. These make it hard for the users to make swaps, and also make it hard for Makers to move liquidity consistently. Which means, the robust Order-Book model isn't easy nor efficient to reproduce.

            <div class="title is-size-4">Constant Product Invariant</div>
            In 2018, Uniswap launched with the revolutionary Automated Market Maker (AMMs) concept. Uniswap uses a product curve for its AMM also called <b>CONSTANT PRODUCT INVARIANT</b>. The concept behind the system is pretty simple. There exists a constant <b class="subtitle">K</b>. The product of number tokens in the pool, should always be equal to this constant <b class="subtitle">K</b>. Say <b class="subtitle">x</b> and <b class="subtitle">y</b> are the number of tokens, The exchange price <b class="subtitle">P</b> of the token is the ratio between the two token volumes. Then

                    The de-merits of this model is clear. The user expects 10 USDC in return, but only gets 9.1 USDC.

            The excess 10 USDC is sent to user.ZERO SLIPPAGE.  Clearly this is the better model right ?

            <div class="title is-size-4">The Differences</div>

            In <b>real world </b> , <b>1 DAI != 1 USDC</b> . There is always a premium, like 1 DAI = 0.99 $USD, while 1USDC = 1.01 $USD. Which means as the sum remains constant even thought the ratio changes and hence the price, the pool still gives out same number of tokens.
            Let's take another example to demonstrate this. After the first 10 DAI to 10 USDC swap, lets do another 10 DAI to 10 USDC swap. The pool now has 110 DAI and 90 USDC.
            <div class="columns">
                <div class="column is-3"></div>
                <div class="column">

                            <p class="title">
                                K = 120 + [USDC] = 200<br>
                                [USDC] = 200-90 = 80  <br>
                            </p>

            </div>
            Once again the pool gives out 10 USDC for 10 DAI, inspite the pool having different ratios. When there is a price discrepancy like 1 DAI = 0.99 $USD, while 1USDC = 1.01 $USD, effectively everyone would drain a pool for profit, simply by swapping in 1DAI for 1USD, as they will make 0.02 USD for every DAI traded in. As a liquidity pool, this is bad news. The liquidity pool could run out of tokens to swap, and also act as an arbitrage bank alone. This is where the Constant Product Invariant shines.

                    The Constant Product AMM is very good at self regulation. One of its key advantages is that as more and more of one token is taken away , it gets more and more expensive to take it away (see slippage is good after all). This is a very effective means of price and ratio calculation. Arbitrageurs consistenly arbitrage rather than mere swap profits, thus keeping the ratio tight and consistent with elsewhere.

            Let's try draining the DAI-USDC Constant Product Invariant AMM. Say a whale decides to swap out the entire 100 USDC by swapping in 100 DAI.

            </div>
            The whale, didn't manage to get any more than 50 USDC. If they tries again, this time with 200 DAI

            </div>
            They only gets 25 DAI out. So the slippage, effectively prevents the draining of the pool by making it financially more expensive.

            <div class="title is-size-4">Uniswap and Curve</div>

            Uniswap uses the Constant Product Invariant for its AMMs. Clearly the pros out-weigh the cons. The slippage itself is dependent on the the liquidity available and the volume of the swap. Also, in the name of capital efficiency, Uniswap V3 has introduced Liquidity Concentration. For stable pairs, this means that the liquidity could be concentrated around 1.

            Curve on the other hand, employs a combination of both Constant Product and Constant Sum Invariants. It simply adds the two formulas to get

            Here <b class="subtitle">D</b> is the total number of tokens in the pool. This however is only applicable for stable-pairs as taking <b class="subtitle">x + y </b>inherently sets the ratio as 1:1 or almost equal value.
            What this achieves is that, within the price range close to 1, it acts as a Constant Sum Invariant and as it moves away from those regions, it starts acting as a Constant Product Invariant. Depending on the volatility of the pair listed, an extra term is added, to boost the Constant Sum Invariant part.

            When this boost is 0, the equation converts to a Constant Product Invariant, while as the boost increases, the AMM acts like a Constant Sum Invariant.

                Thereby Curve achieves almost zero slippage Constant Sum Invariant AMM while also keeping the pool-draining resistance of Constant Product Invariant
                So lets see how Curve and Uniswap v3 stack up in real life. Does Uniswap v3's concentrated liquidity actually beats Curve ?

                    <li>Flipside Crypto have dedicated SQL tables for Uniswapv3, from which the swap data and Liquidiy locked in the respective Pair Pools can be obtained.</li>
                    <li>Flipside Crypto doesn't have a dedicated table for Curve.fi, however the Ethereum tables are organized well enough to extract swap data and liquidity information using the pool-address.</li>
                    <li>For <b>curve.fi</b> we will only consider the <a href="https://curve.fi/3pool"> DAI-USDT-USDC 3pool</a>  </li> 
                    <li>As we are only considering 3pool from curve.fi, we will only consider swaps in Uniswap that are between DAI-USDT-USDC </li>
                    <li> As Uniswap v3 is a relatively newer protocol, while Curve is a well established protocol, we will analyze only data for August,2021. This will keep the external market conditions almost similar for both the two protocols. The 2 months after May 5 launch, we shall hope that has given enough time for it to bed it into the ecosystem.</li>

                        We calculate the slippage from each swap by comparing their USD valuation. Simply subtracting the USD value out from the USD value in and finding its percentage should do the trick.

                Things to remember about slippage histogram :
                <ul>
                    <li>In an ideal swap, we want the slippage to be zero, hence we need the histogram to peak as close to zero as possible. </li>
                    <li>If there is slippage in a trade, we want the slippage optimal. This implies, we want the histogram to be as narrow as possible. If the spread is more, it means there is statistically significant number of swaps with higher slippage.</li>
                    <li>An ideal slippage histogram thus will have zero spread and centered on zero, which is basically a straight line centered on zero.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                From the plots, Curve.fi's superiority is clear. Negative slippage implies that the user effectively profitted from making the trade without even arbitraging. Curve.fi has a good chunk of transactions that profit the user. Uniswap v3 on the other hand has a much spread out ditribution of slippage.

            With a sub 0.01 percent mean, Curve.fi is the clear winner. Curve.fi has completed 75 percent of its swaps with slippage less than that of the mean slippage of Uniswap v3.
            However whats the reason behind it ?.

                Clearly curve.fi has Volume. With almost 7x the liquidity of that of uniswap v3, the 3pool's liquidity itself could drive the slippage down alot. While Uniswap v2 lost to Curve.fi due to math, Uniswap v3 with its upgraded <a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf"> Math </a> ( I tried, but it was way too complicated to simplify ), is definitely expected to perform better than Uniswap v2. However, the insane volume difference is a key factor. 
                <br>
                Uniswap v3's only incentive for providing liquidity is the swap fees itself. However Curve.fi on the other hand has an extra 2+ percent APY in the form of CRV tokens atop the fees. This APY could reach higher APRs via boosting if we consider other solutions like <a href="https://www.convexfinance.com/">Convex finance </a>. While the transaction volume in Uniswap v3 is much greater, the guaranteed APR is a very attractive option for investors. Moreover, Curve also supplies underlying tokens to yield opportunities like Compound and AAVE.

            While yes Curve.fi is still the king of stable coin-swaps, Uniswap v3 is definitely an upgrade. With consistenly attaining sub 0.1 slippage while having just 1/7 th of the Curve's liquidity, the debate is clearly open. Cause with Curve's ginormous liquidity, theoretically Uniswap v3 could topple Curve as king of stableswaps. In future, we could delve deeper in the Uniswap v3 stable pools with more concentrated liquidity. As the liquidity isnt evenly spread among all the pools. Though this was done to simplify the comparison between the 3Pool and the Uniswap pools, my hypothesis is that, the spread could narrow much more when specific liquidity pairs are chosen. This would give us much more clarity into these swaps.
